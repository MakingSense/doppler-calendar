# What are extensions?

Extensions are small software programs that customize the browsing experience. They enable users to tailor Chrome functionality and behavior to individual needs or preferences. They are built on web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

An extension must fulfill a  [single purpose](https://developer.chrome.com/single_purpose)  that is narrowly defined and easy to understand. A single extension can include multiple components and a range of functionality, as long as everything contributes towards a common purpose.

# Files and folders

Every extension has a **JSON-formatted** manifest file, named manifest.json, that provides important information [Example](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest). Then we have the files popup.html which is the popup that we see when we click on the icon of the extension and then we have a configuration.html where we will have more options of the extension. These two files get the styles, images and scripts from the resource folder.
